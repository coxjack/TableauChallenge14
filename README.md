# NYC Citibike Analysis
Challenge 14 for Butler Data Science

## 1. Overview of YC Citibike Analysis
### 
* The goal of this module is to assist in demonstrating data from the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program in order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Visualizaions of the data were created to show that this was good proposal.

## 2. Results
### 
* Visualizations
	- The data was cut in different ways to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week and where the most popular areas where rides took place.

* Checkout Times for Users
	- The peak of duration of rides 5 minutes, most users take bikes for short-medium trips.

* Checkout Times by Gender
	- The same duration model applies when gender is added, Males overwhelmingly use the service more than Female/Unknown.

* Trips by Weekday per Hour
	- 8AM & 5PM-7PM are the peak stop times for users on weekdays and weekends are more evenly dispersed. Many users use bikes for commuting on weekdays.

* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
	- The same stop-time model applies when gender is added and also follows our trip duration chart -- males use the service more than Female/Unknown.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)]()

* User Trips by Gender by Weekday
	- Subscribers use the service more than customers and  there are more trips on weekdays -- as we know, males use the service more than Female/Unknown.

* Top Starting Locations
	- A large majority of the bikes are initially rented in Manhattan, there is a relatively even distribution from everywhere south Hell's Kitchen/Midtown once you reach the Upper West/East side bikes are rented less.

* Top Ending Locations
	- The same model for starting locations applies for ending locations, which fits our findings as most trips are short in duration.

## 3. Summary
### 
* Findings
	- Most of the trips were done by males in populated areas for short amounts of time. If Des-Moines can provide this environment then I think it would make sense to institute a similar bike-sharing program.

*Additional Visualizations
 - Rides Per Hour
	- We already know what the peak hours of the business is but this chart helps shows that in a direct fashion.

 - User Birth Year by Gender
	- This chart gives us a view of our user base and who to market to. We should focus on the age range of 23-41.
